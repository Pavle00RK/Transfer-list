* **Select Items** – Individual or all items on one side can be selected.
* **Move Items** – Selected items can be transferred between the left and right lists.
* **Display Total Items** – The total and selected item count is displayed for each list.
* **Disable Buttons When Necessary** – If there are no items on a specific side, the corresponding buttons are disabled.
